# Employee Tracking Application
## Description
This is an app that I created with TypeScript and SQL. Users can create a database of employees that will keep track of information such as their salary, manager name, department, role title and employee id number. <br><br> A video of the app's functionality can be seen here: https://youtu.be/GHCf__AOA_I <br><br>
